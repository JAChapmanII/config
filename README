Assorted configuration files from ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}.

Help yourself to anything. If you see I mistakenly commited sensitive
material, please let me know. The colorschemes in xcolors/ are almost entirely
not mine. I try to site where I got them from in the header. The wallpapers
were mostly made with konify, and I think I have a gradient in there too.
